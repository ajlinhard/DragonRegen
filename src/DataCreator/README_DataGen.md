# Project Overview
The project is about creating a data generator in pyspark which can be used to create new data sets of random data or mimic an existing data sets structure. The generators will need to handle data cardinality, uniqueness, cardinality, data type, categorical nature, and more. Data will eventually read and write to tools like Kafka, Cassandra, DynamoDB and more.


## Ideas
Col Generators:
- Categorical (using Enum)
- Unique IDs (using UUID or other feature)
- Cardinality 

Data Generators:
The data generators could all be staticmethods in a class?



## Ideas (higher effort):
Batching
- Eventually if the data is of a certain size I will need to create data in batches.

Unique Key Sets (aka foreign keys)
- These key sets must be shared between different tables with 100% or N% overlap with each other.

Hash or Composite Keys
- The column is a composite key using an algorithm such as MD5 to hash, or simple separator like "|" ex: "hello|world|!"

## Data Generation
When efficiently generating random data the ask can be difficult to do efficiently. Generating row-wise vs column-wise (vectorized) data can allow for optimizations.
Options Considered:
1. Python List + random package 
    Hypothesis: Simple approach with built-in common package. Could use futures to parallelize the CPU bound task.
2. NumPy random generation
    Hypothesis: NumPy is written and optimized in C, therefore it may be very fast.
3. Spark UDFs
    Hypothesis: Spark can be parallelized to may workers and servers. So, in a hardware positive (many CPUs + RAM) this method could win.

### Option 1:
With future this method can be very fast and efficient.
```python
import random
import string
import concurrent.futures
import numpy as np
from functools import partial

# Method 1: Using concurrent.futures for parallelization
def generate_random_string(min_length, max_length, charset=None):
    if charset is None:
        charset = string.ascii_letters + string.digits
    
    length = random.randint(min_length, max_length)
    return ''.join(random.choice(charset) for _ in range(length))

def generate_multiple_strings_parallel(count, min_length, max_length, charset=None):
    with concurrent.futures.ProcessPoolExecutor() as executor:
        # Create a partial function with fixed parameters
        func = partial(generate_random_string, min_length, max_length, charset)
        # Execute the function 'count' times in parallel
        return list(executor.map(lambda _: func(), range(count)))
```

### Option 2:
Numpy is fast and optimized. Plus the same futures concept could work if we divide the count of data to be generated by CPU count.
```python

# Method 2: Using NumPy for vectorized operations (fastest for large counts)
def generate_multiple_strings_numpy(count, min_length, max_length, charset=None):
    if charset is None:
        charset = string.ascii_letters + string.digits
    
    # Generate random lengths for each string
    lengths = np.random.randint(min_length, max_length + 1, count)
    
    # Create a list to hold all strings
    result = []
    
    # For each desired length, generate a string of that length
    for length in lengths:
        # Generate indices into the charset
        char_indices = np.random.randint(0, len(charset), size=length)
        # Convert indices to characters and join
        random_str = ''.join(charset[i] for i in char_indices)
        result.append(random_str)
        
    return result
```

### Option 3:
Using a Spark UDF (User-Defined Function) for random string generation has both advantages and disadvantages compared to generating strings in Python and then converting to a Spark column.

In most cases, a Spark UDF for this particular task will likely be slower than the native Python approach for several reasons:

```python
import random
import string
from pyspark.sql.functions import udf
from pyspark.sql.types import StringType

# Define the UDF for random string generation
@udf(returnType=StringType())
def random_string_udf(min_length, max_length):
    length = random.randint(min_length, max_length)
    chars = string.ascii_letters + string.digits
    return ''.join(random.choice(chars) for _ in range(length))

# Usage in a Spark DataFrame
# df = df.withColumn("random_str", random_string_udf(lit(5), lit(15)))
```

Here's why this is generally less efficient than the Python-first approach:

1. **Serialization Overhead**: Spark UDFs require serialization/deserialization between the JVM and Python interpreter, which adds significant overhead.

2. **Row-by-Row Processing**: Spark UDFs typically process data row-by-row rather than in vectorized batches, making them inefficient for operations that could be vectorized.

3. **Poor Parallelism Management**: While Spark excels at distributed data processing, the parallelism within a UDF is not optimally managed for CPU-bound tasks like random string generation.

For better performance, consider:

1. **Generate in Python, then convert to Spark**: Generate all strings using NumPy or parallel Python methods, then create a Spark DataFrame from that collection.

2. **Use Scala UDFs**: If you must use Spark UDFs, writing them in Scala eliminates the Python-JVM serialization overhead.

3. **Use Spark's built-in functions when possible**: For related operations, Spark has optimized functions like `rand()` that are much faster than UDFs.

The most efficient approach depends on your specific workflow and data size, but for pure random string generation, Python's native capabilities (especially using NumPy vectorization) will typically outperform Spark UDFs.
